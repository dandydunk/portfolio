John snoozes his alarm clock, the same time, every new day; this one was no different; last night was like a lady with an attitude, a bitch.  He heard the rain coming down like it was in a rush to get home; as he lied wraped in his red blanket, his head felt like something was jumping in it; he had one too many shots of vodka last night. The only light in the room was his charging cell phone; it blinked on and off. The alarm clock had been cursed at twice; "you stupid piece of shit, i'm trying to sleep"; what a bully he was to many objects. The room was cold and snuffy, he forgot to put his shoes outside.  He was still wearing his socks from last night; he reached for the tv remote, he found it on the floor to the side of the bed. He hit the power button; nothing happened. "oh, fuck you". He hit it again; nothing.  He changed the position it was pointing at; the tv spoke a clicking noise, and then a paid programming dieting show slowy came into focus. He hit the mute button; he was just wanting more light in the room.  He thought of what he needed to do. The tv light shined onto a painting of a woman on his wall; he was starting to get an erection after looking at her. He looked away, and got out of the bed. He put his shoes outside of his door, and then sprayed some air freshener. His belly had started a conversation of small talk, he needed to fill it with something to shut it up. He went into the bathroom and took a quick shower and then brushed his teeth; he pulled an outfit from his closet and then dressed and walked into the kitchen. He filled a bowl with cereal plus milk and quickly devoured it.  He put the bowl and spoon into the sink, grabbed his wallet and keys and walked outside of the door.  He locked the door and stashed the keys into his left pocket.
